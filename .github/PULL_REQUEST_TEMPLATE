## Attribution

If you are not the sole contributor to a contribution (pull request), please identify all
contributors in the pull request comment.

To add a contributor (other than yourself, that's automatic), mark them one per line as follows:

```
+@github_username
```

If you added a contributor by mistake, you can remove them in a comment with:

```
-@github_username
```

If you are making a pull request on behalf of someone else but you had no part in designing the
feature, you can remove yourself with the above syntax.
